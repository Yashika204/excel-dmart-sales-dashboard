# DMart Sales Dashboard (Excel Practice Project)

This is a self-practice project where I created an interactive Excel dashboard using a sample dataset from DMart.

## Features:
- KPI Summary (Total Sales, Orders, Avg Sales/Order)
- Sales trends over time
- Sales analysis by category, region, and segment
- Interactive slicers for filtering data

## Tools Used:
- Microsoft Excel
- Pivot Tables
- Charts & Slicers

This helped me practice and improve my data analysis and Excel dashboarding skills.
